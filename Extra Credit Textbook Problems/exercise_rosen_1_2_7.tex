\begin{problem}[Rosen.1.2.7
]\ \\
Express these system specifications using the propositions
p “The message is scanned for viruses” and q “The
message was sent from an unknown system” together
with logical connectives (including negations).\ \\
\begin{compactenum}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\alph{enumi}}
\item “The message is scanned for viruses whenever the
message was sent from an unknown system.”
\item “The message was sent from an unknown system but
it was not scanned for viruses.”
\item “It is necessary to scan the message for viruses whenever
it was sent from an unknown system.”
\item “When a message is not sent from an unknown system
it is not scanned for viruses.”
