Exercises 19 $\rightarrow$ 23 relate to inhabitants of the island of knights
and knaves created by Smullyan, where knights always tell
the truth and knaves always lie. You encounter two people,
A and B. Determine, if possible, what A and B are if they
address you in the ways described. If you cannot determine
what these two people are, can you draw any conclusions?\ \\
\ \\
\textbf{22.} Both A and B say “I am a knight.”

\ \\
\textit{Propositions}:\ \\
p: A is a knight\ \\
q: B is a knight\ \\
\ \\
$\neg p$: A is a knave\ \\
$\neg q$: B is a knave\ \\
\ \\
In this statement both A and B say that they are knights. Both could be knights or knaves and one of them could be a knight and one of them could be a knave.
