\begin{problem}[Rosen.1.2.37]\ \\
\ \\
Suppose there are signs on the doors to two rooms. The
sign on the first door reads “In this room there is a lady,
and in the other one there is a tiger”; and the sign on the
second door reads “In one of these rooms, there is a lady,
and in one of them there is a tiger.” Suppose that you
know that one of these signs is true and the other is false.
Behind which door is the lady?\ \\

\textit{Propositions}:\ \\
(1) In this room there is a lady, and in the other a tiger.\ \\
(2) In one of these rooms, there is a lady, and in one of them there is a tiger.\ \\

Since B is true when A is true or false and we know that only one is true, the other one must be false and \textbf{the lady is in the second room}.
