\begin{problem}[Rosen.1.2.8]\ \\
Express these system specifications using the propositions
p “The user enters a valid password,” q “Access is
granted,” and r “The user has paid the subscription fee”
and logical connectives (including negations).
\begin{compactenum}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\alph{enumi}}
\item “The user has paid the subscription fee, but does not enter a valid password.”
\item “Access is granted whenever the user has paid the subscription fee and enters a valid password.”
\item “Access is denied if the user has not paid the subscription fee.”
\item “If the user has not entered a valid password but has paid the subscription fee, then access is granted.”
\end{compactenum}
\end{problem}
