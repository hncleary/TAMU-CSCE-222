Exercises 24 $\rightarrow$ 31 relate to inhabitants of an island on which
there are three kinds of people: knights who always tell the
truth, knaves who always lie, and spies (called normals by
Smullyan [Sm78]) who can either lie or tell the truth. You
encounter three people, A, B, and C. You know one of these
people is a knight, one is a knave, and one is a spy. Each of the
three people knows the type of person each of other two is. For
each of these situations, if possible, determine whether there
is a unique solution and determine who the knave, knight, and
spy are. When there is no unique solution, list all possible
solutions or state that there are no solutions.\ \\

\textbf{25.} A says “I am the knight,” B says “I am the knave,” and
C says “B is the knight.”
