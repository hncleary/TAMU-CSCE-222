\begin{problem}[Rosen.1.2.16]\ \\
An explorer is captured by a group of cannibals. There are
two types of cannibals those who always tell the truth
and those who always lie. The cannibals will barbecue
the explorer unless he can determine whether a particular
cannibal always lies or always tells the truth. He is
allowed to ask the cannibal exactly one question.
\begin{compactenum}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\alph{enumi}}
\item Explain why the question “Are you a liar?” does not
work.
\item Find a question that the explorer can use to determine
whether the cannibal always lies or always tells the
truth.
\end{compactenum}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}\ \\
\ \\
\begin{compactenum}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\alph{enumi}}
\item If the explorer encounter the one who tells the truth, then he will answer the question with no. If they encounter the liar the answer will also be no. 
\ \\
\item Ask "If I were to ask if you always tell the truth, would you say that you did?"\ \\
The truthful one will answer with yes and the liar will answer with no. (lying about lying vs being truthful about being truthful)\ \\
\ \\

\end{compactenum}
\end{solution}
