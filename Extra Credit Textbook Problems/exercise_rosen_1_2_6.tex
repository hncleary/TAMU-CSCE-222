% Chapter 1.1, Problem 1
\begin{problem}[Rosen.1.2.6]\ \\
You can upgrade your operating system only if you have
a 32-bit processor running at 1 GHz or faster, at least
1 GB RAM, and 16 GB free hard disk space, or a 64-
bit processor running at 2 GHz or faster, at least 2 GB
RAM, and at least 32 GB free hard disk space. Express
you answer in terms of u: “You can upgrade your operating
system,” b32: “You have a 32-bit processor,” b64:
“You have a 64-bit processor,” g1: “Your processor runs
at 1 GHz or faster,” g2: “Your processor runs at 2 GHz or
faster,” r1: “Your processor has at least 1 GB RAM,” r2:
“Your processor has at least 2 GB RAM,” h16: “You have
at least 16 GB free hard disk space,” and h32: “You have
at least 32 GB free hard disk space.
