Exercises 19 $\rightarrow$ 23 relate to inhabitants of the island of knights
and knaves created by Smullyan, where knights always tell
the truth and knaves always lie. You encounter two people,
A and B. Determine, if possible, what A and B are if they
address you in the ways described. If you cannot determine
what these two people are, can you draw any conclusions?\ \\
\ \\
\textbf{19.} A says “At least one of us is a knave” and B says nothing\ \\

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}\ \\
\ \\
Consider the possibility that A is a knight. Then he is telling the truth and B is a knave.\ \\
\ \\
If A is a knave, then he tells lies and the statement that at least one of them is a knave is wrong. This means that \textbf{A is a knight}a.\ \\
